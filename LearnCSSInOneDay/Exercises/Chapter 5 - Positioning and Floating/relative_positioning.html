    <p>icolas Fouquet, Louis XIV’s finance minister in the first years of his reign,
        generous man who loved lavish parties, pretty women, and poetry.
        He also loved money, for he led an extravagant lifestyle. Fouquet was
        was a
        clever and very much indispensable to the king, so when the prime mim's—
        ter, Jules Mazarin, died, in 1661, the finance minister expected to be
        named the successor. Instead, the king decided to abolish the position. This
        and other signs made Fouquet suspect that he was falling out of favor, and
        so he decided to
        ingraliate himself with the king by staging the most spec-
        tacular party the world had ever seen. The party’s ostensible purpose
        would be to commemorate the completion of Fouquet’s chateau, Vaux—le-
        Vicomte, but its real function was to pay tribute to the king, the guest of
        honor.
        The most brilliant nobility of Europe and some of the greatest minds
        of the Iime—La Fontaine, La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Sévigné—
        attended the party. Moliere wrote a play for the occasion, in which he
        himself was to perform at the evening’s conclusion. The party began with a
        lavish
        seven—course
        dinner, featuring foods from the Orient never be-
        fore tasted in France, as well as new dishes created especially for the night.
        The meal
        was
        accompanied with music commissioned by Fouquet to
        honor the king.
        After dinner there was a promenade through the chateau’s gardens.
        The grounds and fountains of Vaux—le»Vicomte were to be the inspiration
        for Versailles.
        Fouquet personally accompanied the young king through the geomet-
        rically aligned arrangements of shrubbery and flower beds. Arriving at the
        gardens’ canals, they witnessed a fireworks display, which was followed by
        the performance of Moliere’s play. The party ran well into the night and
        everyone agreed it was the most amazing affair they had ever attended.
        The next day, Fouquet was arrested by the king’s head musketeer,
        D’Artagna.n. Three months later he went on trial for stealing from the
        country’s treasury. (Actually, most of the stealing he was accused of he had
        done on the kings behalf and with the king’s permission.) Fouquet was
        found guilty and sent to the most isolated prison in France, high in the
        Pyrenees Mountains, where he spent the last twenty years of his life in soli-
        tary confinement.
        Interpretation
        Louis XIV, the Sun King, was a proud and arrogant man who wanted to be
        the center of attention at all times; he could not countenance being out-
        done in lavishness by anyone, and certainly not his finance minister. To
        succeed Fouquet, Louis chose _]ean—Baptiste Colbert, a man famous for his
        parsimony and for giving the dullest parties in Paris. Colbert made sure
        that any money liberated from the treasury went straight into Louis’s
        hands. With the money, Louis built a palace even more magnificent than
        Fouquet’s—the glorious palace of Versailles. He used the same architects,
        9
        LAW 1decorators, and garden designer. And at Versailles, Louis hosted parties
        even more
        extravagant than the one that cost Fouquet his freedom.
        Let us examine the situation. The evening of the party, as Fouquet pre-
        sented spectacle on spectacle to Louis, each more magnificent than the one
        before, he imagined the affair as demonstrating his loyalty and devotion to
        the king. Not only did he think the party would put him back in the king’s
        favor, he thought it would show his good taste, his connections, and his
        popularity, making him indispensable to the king and demonstrating that
        he would make an excellent prime minister. Instead, however, each new
        spectacle, each appreciative smile bestowed by the guests on Fouquet,
        made it seem to Louis thaticolas Fouquet, Louis XIV’s finance minister in the first years of his reign,
